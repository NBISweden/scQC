## Wishlist

- Background - cellbender, with report on bg signal, or other method.
	- BG score per cell to include in QC plots.
- Emptydrops? Or use cellbender for barcode calls.
- Doublet detection, multiple methods?
- Features, C,F,Mt,Ribo,Hb, PC, ncRNA - all last after mito removal.
	- QC per sample
	- QC per celltype/sample
- Filtering suggestions.
- Cell cycle
- Check sex if mouse/human
- Celltype prediction.
- Check for batch effects - what is best method?
- Percentage top genes.
	- Suggested filtering of genes?
- Gene biotype proportions per sample.
- Stress signal?
- Umap colored by different features, also per dataset??


#### Possible additions in future
- Hashing
- More than RNA assay, CITE/VDJ/ATAC
- Interactive viewer after QC for selecting QC filters.
- Percent spliced/unspliced, if running velocity pipeline
